# MNIST-ML
Trying to predict handwritten digits with different ML models.

This Jupyter notebook uses the datasets from the digit recognition kaggle competition.

However the results were not as good as I was expecting, I could only get the Decision Tree and Random Forests models running in a reasonable time and they only gave an 85% accuracy.
